# Event Ledger Seed

## Purpose

This file is the first public event ledger for the New Zealand demonstrated route.

It is not a finished chronological corpus. It is a first-pass coded ledger built from clear official coordination events so the public schema is no longer only hypothetical.

## Current posture

Current status: `seed ledger`

This ledger is intentionally conservative:

- it uses only events that are clearly visible in the official and oversight source base already assembled publicly
- it tests the public coding schema against real material
- it covers comparator setup, the main perturbation interval, and the Comparator B boundary
- it does not pretend to be exhaustive

## Coding note

This first public pass uses the locked public schema:

- `event_id`
- `timestamp_or_date`
- `issuing_unit`
- `receiving_units`
- `action_type`
- `dependency_type`
- `implementation_marker`
- `public_information_marker`
- `source_citation`
- `confidence_note`
- `scale_tag`

When one official source records a bundled same-day shift, this seed ledger keeps the bundle together rather than forcing false micro-events.

- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`

Why it matters:

This is an early central-governance consolidation event. It matters less because of symbolism than because it creates a more formal strategic receiving point for advice and co-ordination.

- `source_citation`: `src-oag-covid-response-2022` (Part 5, paras. 5.8-5.10); `src-oag-covid-appendix1-2022`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This is a strong cross-unit co-ordination event because it explicitly creates a liaison and control function between strategic and operational layers.

### `nz-p-008`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-03-14`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `border-control coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`

- `source_citation`: `src-beehive-major-steps-covid-2020`; `src-oag-covid-response-2022`; `src-royal-commission-phase-one-2024`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This is the clearest early direct border event in the public route. It shows public information, border control, and compliance logic being pulled into the same coordination bundle before the alert-level escalations.

### `nz-p-004`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-03-19`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`

- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This is a governance-thickening event. It sharpens the route's strategic centre and makes urgent cross-unit decision flow more legible.

### `nz-p-009`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-03-19`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `border-control coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`

- `source_citation`: `src-beehive-stronger-border-measures-2020`; `src-oag-covid-response-2022`; `src-royal-commission-phase-one-2024`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This is a direct border-coordination thickening event. It makes the route's border, compliance, and public-information dependencies much harder to flatten into a purely executive narrative.

### `nz-p-005`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-03-21`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-information coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-service system coordination`

- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event is central for the route because it changes the public communication environment while also creating a more legible cross-unit coordination grammar.

### `nz-p-010`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-03-23`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `emergency-management coordination`; `public-service system coordination`; `border-control coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`

- `source_citation`: `src-beehive-level-3-4-2020`; `src-oag-covid-response-2022`; `src-royal-commission-phase-one-2024`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event separates decision-side escalation from implementation-side lockdown. That matters for later `L` work because it gives the route a cleaner announcement-to-implementation break.

- `implementation_marker`: `implementation initiated`
- `public_information_marker`: `alert-level communication`; `enforcement or compliance communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-oag-covid-response-2022` (Part 5, paras. 5.17-5.18); `src-royal-commission-phase-one-2024`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This is the clearest high-acuity whole-system event in the public route. It couples legal authority, public communication, implementation pressure, and multi-unit dependency in one dense coordination shift.

### `nz-p-007`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-01`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `emergency-management coordination`; `public-service system coordination`; `border-control coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: Quin-centred all-of-government response structure visible in National Action Plan 2.0

- `implementation_marker`: `implementation observed`
- `public_information_marker`: `none recorded`
- `source_citation`: `src-oag-covid-response-2022` (Part 5, Figure 3 and paras. 5.31-5.33); `src-oag-covid-appendix1-2022`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event is useful because it shows the operating structure not just being discussed but stabilized enough to be documented as a concrete coordination architecture.

### `nz-p-019`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-03-31`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-service system coordination`; `border-control coordination`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: all-of-government plan for managing stranded people formalized in Cabinet material
- `dependency_type`: `directive or authority dependency`; `resource or logistics dependency`; `information or reporting dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `implementation initiated`
- `public_information_marker`: `none recorded`
- `source_citation`: `src-dpmc-stranded-people-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event thickens the acute implementation layer by showing that stranded-people management was being formalized as a cross-unit coordination problem rather than left implicit inside the border decision chain.

### `nz-p-014`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-04`
- `issuing_unit`: `enforcement and compliance`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: additional Alert Level 4 rules clarified through Police guidance
- `dependency_type`: `legal or compliance dependency`; `public-communication dependency`; `information or reporting dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `official guidance update`
- `public_information_marker`: `official guidance update`; `enforcement or compliance communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-police-alert-level-4-guidelines-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event adds direct implementation-side compliance clarification inside the Level 4 period. It matters because it shows the route is not made only of top-level strategic announcements; operational rule clarification also becomes visible as part of the coordination architecture.

### `nz-p-020`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-02`
- `issuing_unit`: `public-service system coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `emergency-management coordination`; `border-control coordination`; `public-information coordination`

- `implementation_marker`: `implementation initiated`
- `public_information_marker`: `none recorded`
- `source_citation`: `src-dpmc-quarantine-managed-isolation-welfare-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event makes the quarantine and managed-isolation layer more legible as a welfare and support problem rather than only a border or public-health problem. That matters because it adds one more concrete implementation chain tying service coordination to the wider response architecture.

### `nz-p-021`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-09`
- `issuing_unit`: `emergency-management coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `strategic executive coordination`; `public-service system coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`

- `implementation_marker`: `implementation initiated`
- `public_information_marker`: `none recorded`
- `source_citation`: `src-dpmc-cdem-powers-guidance-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event adds a direct emergency-powers guidance layer to the route. It matters because it shows formal authority routing and operational powers clarification inside the main interval rather than only retrospective descriptions of emergency-management roles.

### `nz-p-022`

- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `emergency-management coordination`; `public-service system coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: review-preparation for New Zealand's Level 4 status formalized in Cabinet material
- `dependency_type`: `directive or authority dependency`; `information or reporting dependency`; `public-communication dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `implementation initiated`
- `public_information_marker`: `none recorded`
- `source_citation`: `src-dpmc-review-level4-status-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event thickens the easing-preparation chain before the public Level 3 announcement sequence begins. It shows that review and transition preparation were being formalized before the later announcement and implementation markers.

### `nz-p-016`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-29`
- `issuing_unit`: `enforcement and compliance`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `border-control coordination`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: Aviation Security and Police continue joint reassurance patrols and quarantine/isolation compliance checks
- `dependency_type`: `legal or compliance dependency`; `resource or logistics dependency`; `public-communication dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `implementation observed`
- `public_information_marker`: `enforcement or compliance communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-police-avsec-working-together-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event keeps the implementation-side layer visible across the shift out of Level 4. It shows that reassurance patrols and quarantine/isolation compliance work remained a live coordination problem even after the acute lockdown stage had started to ease.

### `nz-p-011`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-16`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-service system coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: Alert Level 3 restrictions announced
- `dependency_type`: `directive or authority dependency`; `legal or compliance dependency`; `public-communication dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `decision announced`
- `public_information_marker`: `alert-level communication`; `enforcement or compliance communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-beehive-alert-level-3-restrictions-2020`; `src-royal-commission-phase-one-2024`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This is the first clear public signal that the route is not only escalating but also specifying the conditions for a staged move out of Level 4. It thickens the implementation side of the main interval without pretending the lower-acuity transition had already happened.

### `nz-p-012`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-20`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-service system coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: date for move to Alert Level 3 publicly announced
- `dependency_type`: `directive or authority dependency`; `legal or compliance dependency`; `public-communication dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `decision announced`
- `public_information_marker`: `alert-level communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-beehive-date-move-level-3-2020`; `src-royal-commission-phase-one-2024`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event gives the route a cleaner announcement-to-implementation pair for the Level 3 transition. That matters because it adds a more defensible non-zero lag marker inside the main interval.

### `nz-p-015`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-20`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-service system coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: implementation and compliance framework for the move to Alert Level 3 detailed in Cabinet material
- `dependency_type`: `directive or authority dependency`; `legal or compliance dependency`; `information or reporting dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `implementation initiated`
- `public_information_marker`: `none recorded`
- `source_citation`: `src-dpmc-alert-level-implementation-2020`; `src-beehive-date-move-level-3-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `medium-high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event adds operating-model and compliance-governance detail to the Level 3 transition chain. It makes the route less dependent on announcement-only chronology by showing a more explicit implementation-preparation layer.

### `nz-p-018`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-20`
- `issuing_unit`: `enforcement and compliance`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-service system coordination`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: Police confirm visible compliance, cross-agency support, and education-first enforcement during extended Level 4
- `dependency_type`: `legal or compliance dependency`; `resource or logistics dependency`; `public-communication dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `implementation observed`
- `public_information_marker`: `official guidance update`; `enforcement or compliance communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-police-support-communities-level-4-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event thickens the route's implementation chain at the exact point where Level 4 is being extended and the Level 3 move-date is being set. It shows that enforcement continuity, public guidance, and cross-agency support remained active coordination objects rather than disappearing into the background once the strategic transition language took over.

### `nz-p-023`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-21`
- `issuing_unit`: `emergency-management coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-service system coordination`; `border-control coordination`
- `action_type`: local-authority and CDEM welfare-support criteria widened to meet immediate COVID-19 response needs
- `dependency_type`: `resource or logistics dependency`; `directive or authority dependency`; `information or reporting dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `implementation initiated`
- `public_information_marker`: `none recorded`
- `source_citation`: `src-dpmc-local-authority-welfare-support-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event adds a direct welfare-support financing and delivery layer to the main interval. It matters because it shows local authorities and CDEM groups being pulled more explicitly into immediate COVID-19 support delivery rather than remaining only background institutions.

### `nz-p-017`

- `source_citation`: `src-police-covid-checkpoints-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event matters because it makes local checkpoint governance visible as a coordination object in its own right. It is not just rule enforcement; it is a multi-party coordination problem involving Police, local authorities, emergency-management actors, and community leadership.

- `source_citation`: `src-dpmc-powers-authorisations-level3-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event adds direct authority-routing detail to the late-Level-4 and early-Level-3 transition chain. It makes the move into Level 3 less dependent on announcement pages alone by exposing the formal powers surface behind the implementation handoff.

### `nz-p-013`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-28`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-service system coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: move to Alert Level 3 and first easing from Level 4 begins
- `dependency_type`: `directive or authority dependency`; `legal or compliance dependency`; `public-communication dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `implementation initiated`
- `public_information_marker`: `alert-level communication`; `enforcement or compliance communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-oag-covid-appendix1-2022`; `src-royal-commission-phase-one-2024`
- `confidence_note`: `medium-high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This is the implementation-side counterpart to the Level 3 transition planning chain. It gives the public route a more complete main-interval easing sequence rather than leaving the route stuck at the point of acute lockdown.

### `nz-p-024`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-04-28`
- `issuing_unit`: `enforcement and compliance`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: Police urge the public to keep following the rules at Alert Level 3 as the easing interval begins
- `dependency_type`: `legal or compliance dependency`; `public-communication dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `official guidance update`
- `public_information_marker`: `official guidance update`; `enforcement or compliance communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-police-level-3-following-rules-2020`; `src-police-covid-major-events-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event keeps the implementation layer visible on the first day of Alert Level 3 rather than letting the easing sequence appear as a purely strategic handoff. It shows Police-public guidance continuing as an active routed dependency.

### `nz-p-025`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-05-01`
- `issuing_unit`: `enforcement and compliance`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: Police remind the public of Alert Level 3 restrictions and continued compliance expectations
- `dependency_type`: `legal or compliance dependency`; `public-communication dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `official guidance update`
- `public_information_marker`: `official guidance update`; `enforcement or compliance communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-police-covid-major-events-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event thickens the late main interval by showing that the Level 3 phase still required visible compliance guidance after the initial easing move. It improves the route's continuity on the implementation side without changing the basic window boundaries.

### `nz-p-029`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-05-04`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `emergency-management coordination`; `public-service system coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`

- `dependency_type`: `directive or authority dependency`; `information or reporting dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `implementation prepared`
- `public_information_marker`: `none recorded`
- `source_citation`: `src-dpmc-preparing-review-level3-status-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event makes the late main interval less discontinuous by showing that the Level 3 to Level 2 decision was preceded by a formal review-preparation layer, not just by public speeches and enforcement reminders.

### `nz-p-027`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-05-06`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-service system coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: formal preparation for Alert Level 2 sets guidance revisions, service phasing, and public messaging expectations ahead of the next review
- `dependency_type`: `directive or authority dependency`; `information or reporting dependency`; `legal or compliance dependency`; `public-communication dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `implementation prepared`
- `public_information_marker`: `official guidance update`; `alert-level communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-dpmc-preparing-for-alert-level-2-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event gives the late transition chain one more direct DPMC operating anchor before the Level 2 decision. It makes the move into Comparator B less dependent on speeches and legal passage alone by showing that guidance, local-government services, transport, justice, and wider public messaging were already being staged for the next shift.

### `nz-p-026`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-05-08`
- `issuing_unit`: `enforcement and compliance`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-information coordination`
- `action_type`: Police remind the public New Zealand remains in Alert Level 3 ahead of the next transition decision
- `dependency_type`: `legal or compliance dependency`; `public-communication dependency`
- `implementation_marker`: `official guidance update`
- `public_information_marker`: `official guidance update`; `enforcement or compliance communication`
- `source_citation`: `src-police-covid-major-events-2020`
- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event thickens Comparator B preparation without forcing a new window. It shows enforcement-side guidance still operating immediately before the Level 2 decision point, which helps distinguish late-transition continuity from the earlier acute escalation chain.

## Comparator B boundary markers

- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event makes the Comparator B boundary more than a speech or announcement chain. It adds the legal-handoff layer that helps explain how the move into Level 2 became administratively workable.

### `nz-b-001`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-05-13`
- `issuing_unit`: `emergency-management coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `strategic executive coordination`; `public-information coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`

- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This event marks the legal and operational handoff that leads directly into Comparator B. It is a good example of a lower-acuity but still system-wide coordination shift.

### `nz-b-002`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-05-14`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `public-information coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`; `public-service system coordination`

- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

Comparator B only works if this transition is treated as a real coordination shift instead of a quiet tail end of the same crisis block.

### `nz-b-003`

- `timestamp_or_date`: `2020-06-08`
- `issuing_unit`: `strategic executive coordination`
- `receiving_units`: `public-health policy and command`; `emergency-management coordination`; `public-information coordination`; `enforcement and compliance`

- `confidence_note`: `high`
- `scale_tag`: `sigma1`; `sigma2`; `sigma3`

Why it matters:

This closes Comparator B cleanly and marks the point where the most extraordinary emergency powers fall away.

## What this seed ledger already demonstrates

Even at this first-pass level, the route now has:

- clear cross-unit events
- visible shifts in authority, public communication, and implementation pressure
- direct event-page support for border, alert-level, transition-law, enforcement-guidance, extended-Level-4 enforcement continuity, stranded-people planning, managed-isolation welfare coordination, emergency-powers guidance, Level 3 authority routing, Level 3 review preparation, and local-authority/CDEM support shifts
- enough structure to begin testing simple `I`, `C`, and `L` summaries against real coded material
- enough window depth to support a first conjoint `I/C/L` comparison without pretending the route is complete

What it does **not** yet demonstrate:

- exhaustive chronology
- final lag values
- final edge weighting
- final comparator execution

## Next build step

The next concrete pass should:

1. keep adding D-family `D` and `E` direct-source events only when they satisfy the live-plus-fixed-archive rule and materially deepen implementation or review routing
2. keep the first route-local estimator layer fixed unless the denser ledger forces a rule change
3. stress-test the first conjoint window comparison against deeper implementation, enforcement, and transition-continuity material

## Status
