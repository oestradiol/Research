# Changelog

## Unreleased

- governance validation now ignores live worktree and generated operational artifacts such as `.git/`, `tools/out/`, and local cache directories
- added a first federated validation-cluster prototype with subsystem-owned reports for root governance, SUF active core, Knowledge, and tooling/release checks
- moved subsystem cluster ownership metadata into `governance/SUBSYSTEM_REGISTRY_v0_1.json`, with tooling now deriving cluster specs from the registry instead of hardcoding them in Python

## `1.1.0` - 2026-04-03

Current tooling snapshot aligned to the `v1.1.0` New Zealand monograph-baseline umbrella release.

### Included in this snapshot

- version surfaces aligned to the `v1.1.0` release line
- status-surface validation aligned to the monograph-baseline New Zealand wording and current hosted version
- New Zealand summary parsing made tolerant of the public-ledger wording while keeping the canonical metric checks read-only

## `1.0.1` - 2026-04-02

Current bounded public tooling snapshot inside the umbrella `Research/` repository.

### Included in this snapshot

- direct public status-surface validation for the current hosted release point
- updated NZ and Taiwan route and report tests for the current `38`/`29`/`15` public baseline
- NZ-Taiwan issuing-concentration reporting fixed so tied top issuers render correctly
- documented the tooling-ready validation scope for current `main`
- aligned the tooling backlog to the long-range monograph and bounded-closure phase ladder while keeping docs canonical and tools read-only
