### Hosted history

- repository: [oestradiol/Research](https://github.com/oestradiol/Research)
- tag: [`v1.4.0`](https://github.com/oestradiol/Research/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

### Included in this snapshot

- **New Zealand core**: 38 events, chapter-ready monograph baseline with late-transition DPMC layer
- **Taiwan comparator**: 20 events, chapter-ready with CECC/NHCC architecture visibility
- **Australia federal comparator**: 18 events, AHPPC + National Cabinet dual-layer architecture
- **Three-case synthesis**: 76-event bounded closure documenting patterns that travel (public-information centrality, health-executive bridge, border sequence) and patterns that remain case-specific
- **Rival-framework positioning**: explicit analytical value vs executive-command-only, communication-as-downstream, loose crisis-governance accounts
- **Monograph support package**: chapter TOC, evidence maps, artifact cross-references
- **Comprehensive audit**: Phase 1 complete with red-team challenge, blind spot mapping, meta-audit validation

## Unreleased

- full renewal cycle (2026-04-17): fix stale references, reduce duplication, add self-coverage
  - P0: Fix stale references to deleted files in CURRENT_SURFACES_REGISTRY, AUTHORITATIVE_INTEGRITY_MANIFEST, REPOSITORY_FILE_REGISTRY
  - P1: Redesign CURRENT_SURFACES_REGISTRY as canonical source of truth for current files
  - P1: Update root and SUF AUTHORITATIVE_INDEX to reference canonical registry instead of duplicating
  - P1: Add governance_consistency.py validator to close self-coverage gap
  - P2: Add cross-references between FEDERATED_SUBSYSTEM_PROTOCOL, IMPLEMENTATION_LAYER_POLICY, PACKAGE_MINIMIZATION_POLICY
- add federated subsystem protocol and machine-readable coordination infrastructure
  - `governance/FEDERATED_SUBSYSTEM_PROTOCOL_v0_1.md`: explicit boundaries between root, SUF, knowledge, and tools
  - `governance/SUBSYSTEM_REGISTRY_v0_1.json`: machine-readable registry for subsystem ownership, scope, and validation clusters
- update governance surfaces to reflect federated architecture
- add cluster validation tooling infrastructure
  - `tools/src/research_tools/models/{clusters,subsystems}.py`: data models for federated validation
  - `tools/src/research_tools/parse/subsystems.py`: parser for SUBSYSTEM_REGISTRY
  - `tools/src/research_tools/repo_files.py`: repo file utilities
  - `tools/src/research_tools/workflows/validate_clusters.py`: federated cluster validation workflow
- add knowledge engineering and agentic systems content
  - `knowledge/map/08-integrative-and-reflexive/knowledge-engineering-and-agentic-systems.md`: new deepened hub node
  - `knowledge/study-routes/agentic-workflow-and-knowledge-systems-route.md`: new study route for AI-assisted knowledge systems
- update governance surfaces to reflect federated architecture (AUTHORITATIVE_INDEX, CURRENT_SURFACES_REGISTRY, INTEGRITY_MANIFEST, FILE_REGISTRY, MINIMIZATION_POLICY, AGENT_EDIT_SCOPE_POLICY)
- update tooling architecture and backlog to consume subsystem registry
- update knowledge indexes and cluster README for new content
- add `structured-unity-framework/docs/current-execution-order.md` as the short live sequencing surface for the active `v1.x` pass
- add Taiwan chapter-facing scaffolds: `taiwan-chapter-boundary-and-corpus.md`, `taiwan-chapter-evidence-map.md`, and `taiwan-chapter-table-and-figure-plan.md`
- align tracking and navigation surfaces so Taiwan is the active chapter-readiness workstream rather than an unexposed later branch

## `v1.1.0` - 2026-04-03

New Zealand monograph-baseline release of the full `Research/` repository.

### Hosted history

- repository: [oestradiol/Research](https://github.com/oestradiol/Research)
- tag: [`v1.1.0`](https://github.com/oestradiol/Research/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

### Included in this snapshot

- Structured Unity Framework now carries a chapter-ready New Zealand monograph baseline inside the locked windows, with direct DPMC action-plan, operating-system, public-information, and Level 4 review anchors added to the route-control layer
- Structured Unity Framework now includes explicit New Zealand monograph chapter notes and a monograph-facing table-and-figure plan while keeping the existing validator-facing metric files stable
- Knowledge is carried forward unchanged as the stable sibling atlas with the maintained 9-cluster / 70-node public graph
- Research Tools are aligned to the new `v1.1.0` release line and current monograph-baseline status wording while remaining read-only

## `v1.0.1` - 2026-04-02

Second bounded public release of the full `Research/` repository.

### Hosted history

- repository: [oestradiol/Research](https://github.com/oestradiol/Research)
- tag: [`v1.0.1`](https://github.com/oestradiol/Research/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

### Included in this snapshot

- Structured Unity Framework now hosted at the repo-complete active-core baseline with a hardened `38`-event New Zealand route, a `29`-event main interval, a `15`-event bounded Taiwan comparator, synchronized payoff and status surfaces, and canonical long-range monograph and bounded-closure planning docs
- Knowledge carried forward as the stable sibling atlas with the normalized `knowledge-package-spec.md` surface and a maintained 9-cluster / 70-node public graph
- Research Tools now validate public status surfaces directly and align the tooling backlog to the same long-range phase ladder while remaining read-only
- hosted release metadata, citations, and repo-local release-note surfaces now point to the current `v1.0.1` snapshot

## `v1.0.0` - 2026-04-02

First bounded public release of the full `Research/` repository.

### Hosted history

- repository: [oestradiol/Research](https://github.com/oestradiol/Research)
- tag: [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/oestradiol/Research/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
- freeze commit: [`bcab522`](https://github.com/oestradiol/Research/commit/bcab5227a5ad53c26b68af6f55b0bc48a6cb4f1b)

### Included in this snapshot

- Structured Unity Framework as the academic core, including a `35`-event New Zealand route, a `27`-event main interval, a `12`-event Taiwan starter comparator, a locked payoff sentence, and a public academic front-door note
- Knowledge as a stable sibling atlas with the normalized `knowledge-package-spec.md` surface and a maintained 9-cluster / 70-node public graph
- Research Tools as a public read-only validation and reporting layer for repo-wide links, source policy, route metrics, and release-readiness checks

Future `v1.x` releases are expected to deepen empirical routes, comparative execution, and reproducibility support rather than redefine the current bounded release type.
