# Knowledge Engineering and Agentic Systems

## Cluster link

- [emerges-from](../../_relations/emerges-from.md) [08 Integrative and Reflexive](README.md)

## Study purpose

Study how knowledge systems, graph structures, retrieval layers, and AI agents can be designed to support grounded multi-step work without collapsing into opaque automation or recursive error.

## Key questions

- How should a knowledge system combine documents, typed relations, metadata, and graph structure?
- When should agent workflows use simple chaining, routing, parallel work, or evaluator loops?
- How can AI assistance remain grounded, auditable, and corrigible across long tasks?
- What should stay human-authored, what can be agent-assisted, and what should never be promoted without review?
- How do we keep a recursive knowledge system from becoming a recursive hallucination system?

## Canonical anchors

- knowledge engineering, ontology design, and metadata-system literatures
- knowledge organization, indexing, and information architecture work
- systems engineering, requirements, and model-based design methods
- HCI, service design, and usability evaluation
- software architecture decision and tradeoff-analysis methods
- agent workflows, context engineering, tool use, and evaluation practice
- graph retrieval, hybrid retrieval, and graph-aware summarization work

## Current grounded heuristics

- prefer hybrid retrieval over vector-only retrieval when the question depends on relations, routes, or global structure
- keep markdown or other human-readable notes canonical until a separate graph substrate proves its value
- treat graph structure as organization and routing, not as automatic truth
- separate synthesis agents from verification and promotion gates
- store procedural knowledge as reusable skills or playbooks rather than re-explaining workflows every run
- keep decision logs, risk logs, and confidence signals visible so recursive improvement stays auditable
- let the human operator own objectives, values, and irreversible approvals while the agent owns decomposition, execution, and validation by default
- continue autonomously through clear low-risk steps and return control mainly at real escalation boundaries rather than after every intermediate action
- give cold-start agents a tiny bootloader that routes them to authoritative surfaces instead of stuffing full context into the prompt
- externalize state through repo version, commit, dirty-state, and file references rather than relying on long conversational memory
- allow machine-internal compression only when relevant state remains lossless and the human-facing substrate stays readable
- run periodic recompression-and-rebirth passes so long-lived knowledge systems do not quietly turn maintenance debt into epistemic debt
- prefer federated subsystems with explicit local ownership and small shared protocols over one growing central surface that tries to do everything
- keep human-readable policy and machine-readable registry layers distinct, then make tooling derive from the registry instead of mirroring ownership metadata in code
- treat implementation layers as different jobs: Markdown for public truth, JSON for machine coordination, Nix for reproducible skeletons, Python for glue and validation, shell for thin operator edges, and compiled languages only when safety/runtime pressure justifies promotion
- externalize durable research deltas with provenance, short summary, target node or file, and status instead of leaving them only in prompt-local reasoning
- treat a refactor wall as a real phase transition when duplicated truth, rising navigation burden, ambiguous ownership, or validator fragility appear even if day-to-day work still seems possible
- require architecture and layer decisions to carry an evidence packet with alternatives, objections, and revisit triggers rather than letting stack choice collapse into habit

## SUF hook / route note

SUF is useful here mainly as a boundary and claim-discipline scaffold: it helps distinguish structure from interpretation, and route logic from proof. But this node should remain led by knowledge organization, HCI, systems engineering, software architecture, and AI-governance traditions rather than by SUF alone.

## Status

`deepened hub node`


## SUF handoff note

Here SUF should not remain in the foreground by inertia. This node is best treated as domain-native lead work, with SUF acting only as one optional discipline for boundary control and relation typing.


## Additional design pressure: self-reference, convergence, and heterogeneous agents

A long-lived human+agent knowledge system should assume drift unless it actively resists it. That means rebirth cycles should not only clean and compress; they should also inspect whether the system can still reason about and improve its own scaffolding. A subsystem that can test other parts but has no path to test itself is a structural blind spot.

This does not license infinite meta-recursion. The target is disciplined convergence: use accumulated research to improve governance, tooling, and interfaces while keeping the system minimal, complete at the relevant level, and resistant to stale legacy growth.

The system should also assume heterogeneous operators from the start. Different agents and proto-agents have different strengths, weaknesses, and context limits. Coherence therefore has to come from explicit protocols, trust boundaries, validation surfaces, and file-grounded handoffs rather than from assuming that every operator will think the same way or notice the same failures.
